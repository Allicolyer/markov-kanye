      <div class="my-3">
        This site uses Markov chains to generate quotes that sound like Kanye
        West.
      </div>
      <h3 class="title my-3">Markov Chains Explained</h3>
      <div class="mb-3">
        A ‘Markov Process’ is a process for which the probability of the next
        thing that will happen only depends on the last thing that happened, and
        not everything before it. Let’s say you wanted to make a prediction
        about whether a sports team will win their next game. Instead of looking
        at the team’s winning history, you look only at the last one or two
        games and decide based on that. This is the idea behind Markov chains.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Markov chains are frequently used to generate text that mimics the style
        or sound of some other text. For example, let’s create a Markov chain to
        generate sentences that sounds like Dr. Suess. Our input sentence is:
        “One fish two fish red fish blue fish”. To create the Markov chain, we
        first go through each word in the sentence and write down the word that
        comes next. So, the word ‘fish’ comes after ‘one’, and the word ‘two’
        comes after ‘fish’. We do this until we’re finished with our input.
      </div>
      <ul class="mb-3">
        <li>one: fish</li>
        <li>fish: two, red, blue</li>
        <li>two: fish</li>
        <li>red: fish</li>
        <li>blue: fish</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="mb-3">
        We now have a Markov chain that can be used to generate a new Dr. Suess
        sentence. To do that, first, pick a word to start with, let’s say ‘two’.
        Pick one word that comes after ‘two’ and add it to the sentence. Here it
        would be ‘fish’.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        “Two fish”
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        The last word in our sentence is fish, so now pick a word from the
        Markov chain that comes after ‘fish’ and add it to the sentence. Let’s
        say we pick ‘blue’.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        “Two fish blue”
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Now ‘blue’ is the last word, so pick a word that comes after ‘blue’ in
        our Markov chain and add it to the sentence. After a few more
        iterations, we’ll get something that sounds like Dr. Suess.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        “Two fish blue fish red fish two”
      </div>
      <h3 class="title my-3">How Kanye.fun works</h3>
      <div class="mb-3">
        This site builds a Markov chain from two-hundred different Kanye West
        quotes and uses that chain to generate quotes in a similar style to
        Kanye. The Markov chain weights word differently based on how often they
        appear next to each other. So for instance, if six quotes have the
        combination ‘I am’ and only one has the combination ‘I have’, ‘I am’ is
        six times more likely to appear in a generated quote than ‘I have’. Just
        like with any Markov chain, there is always a chance that the generated
        Kanye West quote is actually a real Kanye West quote.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Switching between ‘more random’ and ‘less random’ lets you choose
        between using a first-order Markov chain and a second-order Markov
        chain. First-order Markov chains use only on the last word to pick the
        next word in a sentence. Second-order Markov chains use the last two
        words in a sentence to predict the next one. The second-order chain
        generates quotes that sound more like Kanye, while the first-order chain
        generates sentences that are more jumbled and random.
